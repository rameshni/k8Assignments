Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.

#Delete voting pod:
pod deleted but one more pod was spawned by Replica set
No impact. able to vote and observe result

#Delete worker pod:
pod deleted but one more pod was spawned by Replica set
No impact. able to vote and observe result
Logs relaed to voting are lost but its not an issue


#Delete db pod:
pod deleted but one more pod was spawned by Replica set
But previous data is lost. so all old votes are not seen.
new voting is flowing but results are not updated
worker pod restarted as connect to db(old) could not be done.
But result is not reflecting. and from log socket is closed

[root@ip-172-31-45-169 example-voting-app]# kubectl delete po result-5d57b59f4b-wcx5n
pod "result-5d57b59f4b-wcx5n" deleted
